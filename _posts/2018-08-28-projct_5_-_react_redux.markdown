For this project I decided to keep it simple to make sure I completely understood all the elements that were required. The app/webpage I made is basically a virtual cookbook. There is no log in required, anyone can use it and see what other people post. People have the ability to post their favorite recipes. They will be asked to input a name, picture, ingredients, and instructions. 

For styling I used the CSS framework Bulma as I did for the other projects in this curriculum. Nothing against Bootstrap, but I've enjoyed using Bulma, especially for how they define their class names. Incorporating Bulma into React was very simple. Just download the dependency and import the file and away you go!

The number one reason I enjoyed working with React was JSX. The "hybrid language" of Javascript and HTML  felt like a shortcut dream, however it wasn't enough to fully win me over. As I've grown as a developer these past months, using Ruby for both the front and back end felt easier to keep everything together. However, I do want to experiment more with React by expanding on this project and possibly building my own personal webpage/portfolio with React.
