Exhausted. After finishing this project I am exhausted. For many different reasons this project did not flow smooth like I thought it would. Mistake after mistake was made and this could be seen by the many commits. Thankfully though I am glad I made all those mistakes because I feel I have an even better understanding of Rails now. 

Am I happy with my project? Yes and No. I'm happy that it works (obviously, right?!) and the overall way that the app functions. I'm not super thrilled with the way it looks. I'm going to spend more time on it in the future to make it pretty and to possibly add more functions to it. It's a fairly simple app that has the potential for so much more. 

The app I created was a video-game library of sorts. A user can log in and keep track of the different consoles they have along with the games for those consoles. You can signup either by creating a username and password or through facebook. 

If you would like to see a walkthrough of the app here is the link: https://youtu.be/dxzKfbyb748
