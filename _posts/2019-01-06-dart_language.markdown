In previous posts I have written about CoffeScript and TypeScript, languages that compile into JavaScript. Continuing on that trend this post is about Dart. Here is a quick rundown on the language: 

**Website:** https://www.dartlang.org

**Creator:** Google 

**Example:** This is from the Dart website. 

```
// Define a function.
printInteger(int aNumber) {
  print('The number is $aNumber.'); // Print to console.
}

// This is where the app starts executing.
main() {
  var number = 42; // Declare and initialize a variable.
  printInteger(number); // Call a function.
}
```

**Notes:** As I mentioned for both TypeScript and CoffeScript, the best way to start to dive in is to go their official websites as they are super helpful in learning the ins and outs of the language. One thing to note is that 'Type' and 'Coffee' are more compile-to-JavaScript language while Dart heads into being its own stand-alone language.
