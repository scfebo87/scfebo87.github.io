After finishing the program there are many places to continue to practice your coding skills. I though it would be a good idea to make a list of some the sites I've taken advantage of since graduating. 

1. www.coderbyte.com

*This site has a number of challenges that you can complete in different languages that are free. There is a premium option that gives you more challenges. The site also has a section to learn/practice algorithims, free one week courses, and a forum to get questions answered.*

2. www.codewars.com

*Here you complete challenges called "kata" and earn "ranks". The site is community driven where you see how others completed the challenges. There is also a section called "kumite" which is sort of a coding forum or as they like to call it a "coding dojo".*

3. www.codingame.com

*This site is both fun and possibly life changing. The coding challenges are attached to a game that you move up by answering the question. What could be life changing is you can have companies see your profile that could get you noticed for job opportunities.*
