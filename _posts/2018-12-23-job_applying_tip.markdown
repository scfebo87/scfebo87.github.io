When applying for jobs through indeed some employeers might have set up a 10 question quiz for you to take based on the language skills they are looking for. These quizes are set up with indeed and are called assessments. I recently have taken two of these, one on PHP and the other SQL. I wanted to write this post for those that will be applying for jobs soon and since indeed is one of the more popular places to look for jobs, they'll  know it's coming. Here are two examples of questions that might be asked on these tests. They are multiple choice and the questions are timed(around 2 min. a question). These examples come from indeed. 

```
Which line of code will cause an exception or error?

1. Line 160

```


```
Given the data model below, which SQL query would you choose to display the columns supplier_name, city, and product_name? (HINT: The result must show only those suppliers that provide products.)

   1. SELECT supplier_name, city, product_name FROM suppliers s INNER JOIN products p ON (s.supplier_id = p.supplier_id)
   2. SELECT supplier_name, city, product_name FROM suppliers s RIGHT OUTER JOIN products p ON (s.supplier_id = p.supplier_id)
   3. SELECT supplier_name, city, product_name FROM suppliers s LEFT OUTER JOIN products p ON (s.supplier_id = p.supplier_id)
   4. SELECT supplier_name, city, product_name FROM suppliers s INNER JOIN products p ON (s.supplier_id = p.supplier_id) WHERE s.supplier_id <> NULL
   5. SELECT supplier_name, city, product_name FROM suppliers s OUTER JOIN products p ON (s.supplier_id = p.supplier_id)
```
