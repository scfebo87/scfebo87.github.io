I decided ths week to dive into the programing language Python as it's not only one the most popular languages out there, but I also see a lot of jobs postings looking for Python Developers. It has a large community of users so help is readily available and Python is used by companies such as Google, Youtube, and Dropbox to name a few. Like Ruby, it's a great first language to learn since it reads like English. Being that this is not my first language, so far learning has been easy to pick up.  Here are some examples of Python syntax: 

*Strings*

Strings can be written with either as "Hello" or 'Hello'. You cannot combine quotes such as "Hello'. If you have a string that is more than one line use triple quotes: 

```
new_string = """This string
is on 
multiple lines!"""
```

*Datatypes*

If you want to convert a string to a number or vice versa:

```
string = "2"
number = 1
sentence = "I am looking at " + str(number) + " onion."
adding_numbers = int(string) + int(string)
```
