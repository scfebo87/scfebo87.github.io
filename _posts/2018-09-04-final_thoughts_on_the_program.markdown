Most of my career has been in the world of sales and when I started this program I had only a little expereince in coding, but was enjoying it tremendously. My fear though was that I was going to realize during the program that either this field wasn't for me after all or I would start to dislike programming. Thankfully none of those things occured. I am very much looking forward to leaving the sales environment behind for good and starting a career as a developer. 

I was asked recently now that I've basically finished the program if I enjoy or perfer front or back end programming more and I honestly don't have an answer to that yet. My mind has been so busy learning everything Flatiron has given me to learn, and trying to learn it well, that I haven't put much thought into whether I have a preference. I think when it comes to applying for jobs I'll be applying for both types of developer work since I don't want to be too picky. 

If some one were to ask me if I would reccomend the program I would absolutley say yes and I would make sure to give them the advice of reading, or at least save for reading later, the resources that Flatiron gives you at the end of the lessons. You might be tempted to look past them thinking it's material that's going to say the same thing you just read or it's not that important, but no and no. Even if some of the resources are the "same thing" you just read, doesn't mean that reading the material from a different voice will not help you learn better. Also if the resouces point to something "extra", it will probably come in handy when you're working on your projects. 

I'm not sure what the next few months looking for a job will look like, but I am excited to start the next part of this journey and seeing what else this new world of programming has to offer.
