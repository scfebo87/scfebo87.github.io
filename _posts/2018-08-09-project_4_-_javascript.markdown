As a continuation of our rails app from the previous project, I had to add dynamic features using jquery and ajax requests.  With all of these new features to coding I've been learning, I find myself thinking the concepts sound easy, but then turn out much more difficult to execute. This project was no different, but I am happy to say that the features I added are working and I guess you can't ask for much more than that....at least not today :) 

The most difficult part of the project for me was understanding templates. Something about it compiling the script using with lodash or handlebars was not computing in my brain. If I was meant to understand it, then someone hacked into me and loaded a preventDeafult() function! I wound up using lodash for this project since my templates weren't as big and I honestly found it easier to work with. 

Lastly, I want to mention that it although it seems like years ago that I worked on my first CLI project, all of the concepts seem to be sticking. I thought going into this section that Javascript might be the language I fall in love with, even more than I love Ruby right now, but that has not happened yet. I'm excited to dive in to React as I hear it is very popular right now.
