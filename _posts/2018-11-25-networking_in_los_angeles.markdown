Every week, Flatiron sends out an email with a list of meet-ups/events in your area, however for the Los Angeles community there is usually only two or three listed. I thought it would be a good idea to list the meet-ups in the area that I know of if anyone is looking for new places to check out. The ones that are listed here are with recent bootcamp graduates in mind. 

1. https://www.meetup.com/LearnTeachCode/
